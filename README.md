# Automatic Backup with Cryptomator and MEGA

In order to use the script, you need the following things:

1. rsync
2. java
3. davfs
4. Megatools
5. Cryptomator-CLI

Downloaded everything? Good. No idea why you would actually want to use my script, but hey. To each their own.

Now you only have to set your own paths and password in the script. And don't forget the mega config.

And that's it! Wow, you're so smart!
